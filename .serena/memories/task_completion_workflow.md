# Task Completion Workflow

## Current State (No Tools Configured)
The project currently lacks development tooling, so manual verification is required.

## What Should Be Done After Code Changes

### 1. Manual Code Review
- Check type hints are properly used
- Verify docstrings follow Google style
- Ensure error handling is appropriate
- Confirm fallback strategies are in place

### 2. Manual Testing
- Run the main application: `python src/content_pipeline/main.py`
- Test with different command line arguments
- Verify Google Sheets integration still works
- Check RSS feed parsing functionality

### 3. Dependency Management
- Update requirements.txt if new packages added: `pip freeze > requirements.txt`
- Ensure all imports are properly organized

### 4. Git Workflow
```bash
git status                  # Check changes
git add .                   # Stage changes
git commit -m "message"     # Commit with descriptive message
git push                    # Push to remote
```

## Recommended Improvements Needed
1. Add testing framework (pytest)
2. Add code formatting (Black, isort)  
3. Add linting (flake8, pylint)
4. Add type checking (mypy)
5. Set up pre-commit hooks
6. Create requirements-dev.txt for development tools
