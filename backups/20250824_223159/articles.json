After plunging in May, imports surged to an early peak when the president paused the 145% tariff on Chinese goods. Now, companies appear to be trying to avoid another inventory hangover as questions persist about the health of the consumer. What does this mean for transportation markets for the rest of the year?\nShifts in sourcing\nUpstream, one of the biggest shifts has been the continued pullback from China. Import bookings from China to the U.S. are down 25% year-over-year, while Vietnam is one of the few countries showing annual growth as of last week.\nChina has offset much of the decline, however, as total export bookings remain nearly flat compared to 2024, according to SONAR data.
